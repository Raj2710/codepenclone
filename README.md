Hi there!
This is my another interesting application which is a clone of codepen.io
I have used codemirror and react-codemirror2 which provides a good text editor api.
Created Custom hooks to store the documents in Local storage and save it for future use.
Checkout the app here https://codepenbyraj.netlify.app/

Future updates:
Saving the pen in db
providing list of pen's created by users
